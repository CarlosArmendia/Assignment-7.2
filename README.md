# Assignment-7.2
Assignment 7.2 for the AIT620 course - Clustering Sales Data Using K-Means
In this assignment we will work on the Sales Transaction Dataset Weekly dataset, which 
contains the weekly sales data of 800 products over 1 year. This dataset won't contain 
any information regarding the product except sales. 

My goal will be to identify products with similar sales trends using the k-means 
clustering algorithm. I will have to experiment with the number of clusters in order 
to find the optimal number of clusters
